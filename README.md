# Introduction

AthenaCLI is a command line interface (CLI) for the [Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) service that can do auto-completion and syntax highlighting, and is a proud member of the dbcli community.

# Quick Start

## Install

If you already know how to install python packages, then you can simply do:

``` bash
$ pip install athenacli
```

If you don't know how to install python packages, please check the [Install](./docs/install.rst) page for more options (e.g brew, docker)

## Config

A config file is automatically created at `~/.athenacli/athenaclirc` at first launch (run athenacli). See the file itself for a description of all available options.

Below 4 variables are required. If you are a user of aws cli, you can refer to [awsconfig](./docs/awsconfig.rst) file to see how to reuse credentials configuration of aws cli.

``` text
# AWS credentials
aws_access_key_id = ''
aws_secret_access_key = ''
region = '' # e.g us-west-2, us-east-1

# Amazon S3 staging directory where query results are stored.
# NOTE: S3 should in the same region as specified above.
# The format is 's3://<your s3 directory path>'
s3_staging_dir = ''
```

or you can also use environment variables:

``` bash
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
$ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
$ export AWS_ATHENA_S3_STAGING_DIR=s3://YOUR_S3_BUCKET/path/to/
```

## Create a table

``` bash
$ athenacli -e examples/create_table.sql
```

You can find `examples/create_table.sql` [here](./examples/create_table.sql).

## Run a query

``` bash
$ athenacli -e 'select elb_name, request_ip from elb_logs LIMIT 10'
```

## REPL

``` bash
$ athenacli [<database_name>]
```

# Features

- Auto-completes as you type for SQL keywords as well as tables and columns in the database.
- Syntax highlighting.
- Smart-completion will suggest context-sensitive completion.
    - `SELECT * FROM <tab>` will only show table names.
    - `SELECT * FROM users WHERE <tab>` will only show column names.
- Pretty prints tabular data and various table formats.
- Some special commands. e.g. Favorite queries.
- Alias support. Column completions will work even when table names are aliased.

Please refer to the [Features](./docs/features.rst) page for the screenshots of above features.

# Credits

A special thanks to [Amjith Ramanujam](https://github.com/amjith) for creating pgcli and mycli, which inspired me to create this AthenaCLI, and AthenaCLI is created based on a clone of mycli.

Thanks to [Jonathan Slenders](https://github.com/jonathanslenders) for creating the [Python Prompt Toolkit](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit), which leads me to pgcli and mycli. It's a lot of fun playing with this library.

Thanks to [PyAthena](https://github.com/laughingman7743/PyAthena) for a pure python adapter to Athena database.

Last but not least, thanks my team and manager encourage me to work on this hobby project.
