# Credits

A special thanks to [Amjith Ramanujam](https://github.com/amjith) for creating pgcli and mycli, which inspired me to create this AthenaCLI, and AthenaCLI is created based on a clone of mycli.

Thanks to [Jonathan Slenders](https://github.com/jonathanslenders) for creating the [Python Prompt Toolkit](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit), which leads me to pgcli and mycli. It's a lot of fun playing with this library.

Thanks to [PyAthena](https://github.com/laughingman7743/PyAthena) for a pure python adapter to Athena database.

Last but not least, thanks my team and manager encourage me to work on this hobby project.
